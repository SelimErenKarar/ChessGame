# INTRODUCTION
The game is played on a 8 by 8 chessboard. The board is initially filled with chess pieces in the regular way that each piece should be placed, at their starting position. For example, the second row is filled with pawns. The rooks are placed in the corners, the knights next to them, followed by the bishops and finally the queen, and the king on the remaining spaces. 

The rows on the chessboard are called ranks and the columns are called files. The ranks are labelled from 1 to 8 and the files are labelled from a to h. These numbers and letters are used as a coordinate system, in order to describe where the pieces are positioned on the chessboard. The letter always comes first and the number follows it. The aim is to beat the opponent by capturing opponent's King which ends the game. 

# Game Elements, Chess Pieces and Moves
•	8*8 game board
•	2 players. Players are represented by their pieces in white or black colors (Blue is used for white, red is used for black in examples below).
•	6 chess pieces and their special moves are as follows:
o	King (K) moves one square in any direction, so long as that square is not attacked by an enemy piece. When the king is captured, game is over.
o	Queen (Q) moves diagonally, horizontally, or vertically any number of squares. She is unable to jump over pieces.
o	Rooks (R) move horizontally or vertically any number of squares. They are unable to jump over pieces.
o	Bishops (B) move diagonally any number of squares. They are unable to jump over pieces.
o	Knights (N) move in an ‘L’ shape’, e.g. two squares horizontally (or vertically), then one square vertically (or horizontally). They are the only pieces able to jump over other pieces.
o	Pawns (P) move vertically forward one square, with the option to move two squares if they have not yet moved. They capture other pieces diagonally in a one square forward direction. Pawns are unable to move backwards on captures or moves. 

# Special Chess Moves
•	Castling: A player moves his/her king two squares over to one side and then move the rook to the square that the king crossed last. Castling on the kingside is called castling short (the rook moves a short distance, i.e. two squares) while castling on the queenside is called castling long (the rook moves a long distance, i.e. three squares).
This special move can be done only if the king has never moved, the rook involved has never moved, the squares between the king and the rook involved are unoccupied, the king is not in check, and the king does not cross over or end on a square attacked by an enemy piece. 

•	Promotion: When a pawn reaches the other side of the board, the player must promote it to another piece (such as a queen). Then pawn moves like that piece. 

•	En passant: If a pawn moves out two squares on its first move, and by doing so lands to the side of an opponent's pawn, that other pawn has the option of capturing the first pawn as it passes by.
